Adult oysters are sessile and will settle on any hard substrate in the intertidal and shallow subtidal zones, to a depth of about 3 metres. They favour brackish waters in sheltered estuaries, however Pacific oysters can tolerate a large range of salinities and water quality.  The flat or native oyster is found throughout the marine and estuarine habitats of southern Australia, from mid NSW to the southern parts of Western Australia and Tasmania.
